                    <h1>The <em>Solution</em></h1>
                </div>
                <p>There is also a serious problem in that most people’s circadian rhythms run faster than society’s clocks. Many internal, biological clocks are on a 26-hour cycle, while the world operates on a 24-hour day. There are things you can do, though, to reset your internal clock. Expose yourself to sunlight as soon as possible after rising. Light signals the brain to set most of the body’s biological clocks. If you suspect a medical cause, then guidance from a health care professional is clearly warranted. Otherwise, consider doing some of the following:</p>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <div class="masonry">
                        <div class="row">
                              <br>
                          <ul>
                              <li><strong>Get low impact exercise</strong> early in the day. It stimulates your mind plus sets in motion a series of physiological events that result in your body gradually slowing down over the course of the day.</li>
                              <li><strong>Get out of bed</strong> if you haven’t fallen asleep within 20 minutes. Lying there worrying about not being able to sleep only protracts the problem. Do something boring - C-SPAN and local government access cable channels are excellent to watch, or read one of those dry trade journals you’ve brought home from work.</li>
                              <li><strong>Relax</strong>. Use progressive muscle relaxation exercises, deep breathing, or simply count sheep. By concentrating on such efforts, you block troublesome thoughts, which can keep you awake.</li>
                              <li><strong>Drink a glass of warm milk</strong>. Yes, mother was right. We now know why. Milk contains an amino acid, which creates a chemical chain reaction in the brain that helps induce sleep. But, if you suffer from indigestion or acid reflux, milk can actually intensify such gastric discomforts. Experiment to see if this is an option.</li>
                              <li><strong>Watch what you eat</strong>. Fatigue may be due to eating the wrong foods. Studies have shown that approximately two hours after consuming a meal rich in carbohydrates, you will experience fatigue as well as impaired performance on tests requiring speed and concentration. That's because the consumption of carbohydrates facilitates the transport of tryptophan into the brain. The more tryptophan that gets into the brain, the more there is available to be converted into serotonin, a neurotransmitter that stimulates sleep. Timing is everything. Save carbohydrates for dinner, not for the lunch you might consume a couple of hours before having to go into a high-powered, demanding meeting.</li>
                              <li><strong>Get something hot</strong>. There are health benefits associated with ingesting hot peppers and sauces that contain capsaicin, which imparts the hot flavor. But don't have a snack with Tabasco sauce just before you go to bed; it may trigger indigestion. That might be what's waking you up in the middle of the night.</li>
                              <li><strong>Smoking cigarettes can disrupt your sleep cycle</strong>. Carbon monoxide, which is found in tobacco smoke, can interfere with the ability of red blood cells to transport oxygen throughout the body. The less oxygen you have, the less energy you're going to have.</li>
                              <li><strong>Smoking cigarettes can disrupt your sleep cycle (continued)</strong>. Smoking also can impede blood flow and the transport of oxygen by triggering the accumulation of mucous in both the windpipe and the bronchial tubes. This, in turn, will constrict blood vessels and the oxygenation of cells in the body.</li>
                              <li><strong>Avoid caffeine</strong>, especially after about 5:00 in the afternoon, and remember there is as much caffeine in a can of cola as there is in half an average cup of coffee. Perhaps, you were able to get away with drinking huge amounts of this and other caffeine-containing beverages when you were younger. But, as you age and your metabolism slows, it's going to take longer for the body to break the caffeine into its various metabolites. Therefore, the caffeine will remain in your system for a longer period of time. Just because you were able to get away with drinking large amounts of coffee as a student, don't be surprised if those old habits are associated with some consequences later in life.</li>
                              <li><strong>Stay away from sleeping pills</strong>. The benzodiazepines and barbiturates are addictive, and eventually you'll have no choice but to take these medications if you're going to get any sleep at all. You also should avoid nightcaps. One national survey reports that 29% of people who report difficulty sleeping rely upon alcohol in order to induce a state of relaxation. There’s no question that alcohol will induce a state of sleep, but the quality of the sleep you get is lowered, and it's almost guaranteed that you will be prone to waking up, usually about four to five hours after you fall asleep. Alcohol also can impair your ability to take in oxygen. It causes over-relaxation of the muscles and inhibits the respiratory system. The net result is a reduction in your ability to breathe efficiently. All of these things reduce levels of energy.</li>
                              <li><strong>Create a diversion</strong>. There are lots of things you can do to divert yourself, so find a technique that you feel comfortable with and use it. Whatever you do, do it vividly. If you are counting sheep, then visualize each sheep in your mind in order to block intrusive thoughts. Concentrate on your body relaxing, and chances are you won't even recall what number you got to before you fell asleep. You also can count your blessings, adding a sense of joy or gratitude to your relaxation.</li>
                              <li><strong>There is nothing wrong with healthy worrying</strong>. It's only when the worrying interferes with sleep or other functions you have to perform. Set aside time to worry some time before you go to bed. Get it out of your system. While you are doing this, think about what it is you're going to do the next day. List the most important tasks you need to accomplish, so that when you awaken, you'll know exactly what needs to be done. And don’t do your worrying in bed or in your favorite chair. Otherwise, the bed will trigger worrying, just as Pavlov’s bell triggered salivation in dogs.</li>
                              <li><strong>Turn the clock</strong>. Don't have your clock staring at you next to the bed, so that every time you open your eyes, you are aware of how late it is and the fact that you are still not asleep. Turn it so that you have to expend some effort in order to see what time it is.</li>
                              <li><strong>Cool down</strong>. What enables you to fall asleep is a subtle drop in body temperature. You can fool your body into activating processes that lower your temperature by jumping into a hot tub or taking a hot bath about an hour before you are ready for bed. The brain will be fooled into thinking you are in danger of dying from hyperthermia. Consequently, it activates processes designed to lower your body temperature sufficiently to compensate for the extra heat. When you leave the source of heat, those processes continue to work, so your body temperature actually drops below normal. You'll have to experiment to determine exactly how long, in advance, you need to do this. Exercise also will work. When you exercise, you temporarily increase your core body temperature. Just make certain that you work out early in the evening so that your body has a chance to cool down and to enter into that over-compensation stage at the time you want to sleep.</li>
                              <li><strong>Exercise</strong>. If you are a man in your 50's, you might be waking in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. As men age, the prostate gland can swell and partially block the urethra. This triggers the need for frequent urination. Obviously, if you cut back on fluid intake before going to bed, this will help; however, a small amount of light exercise an hour before bedtime will work as well. Don't do anything aerobic, simply some very easy, stretching exercises or a short, five-minute walk. This will stimulate the circulation of fluids through the kidneys, and it will prompt you to get rid of a little more fluid before you go to bed.</li>
                              <li><strong>Establish a sleep pattern</strong>, and make sure that you stay with it. Sleep is one of the easiest things to condition in humans. If you train your body to get used to falling asleep at a certain time of night, it's more likely to happen.</li>

            <p class="p1"><b class="b1">CAUTION</b>
                  <br>
Realize that sleep disorders and fatigue may be secondary to an illness, which cannot be regulated through behavior or supplements. For that reason, it is important to have a thorough physical examination to rule out such a cause</p>
<br>
<p>Even after a restful night’s sleep, you still need to maintain the energy with which you awakened. That’s best done with the right food. Since food is the fuel of the body, you’d think that with more, you’d be able to go further and last longer. To a certain extent, that is true. The average person needs between about 1500 and 2000 calories per day to keep the body going and to make it through the workday. However, more is less important than type and time when it comes to having energy. Lack of energy is what erodes your motivation and keeps you from doing what you want to do. Ask an athlete about ‘hitting the wall’ or ‘bonking.’ These expressions refer to the almost total collapse of the body, usually at a point midway through a long-endurance event. Blood sugar drops, and the athlete’s energy level bottoms out. It can happen to anyone, though, and will if you eat too much or too little, at the wrong time of day, or in the wrong proportions of protein, carbohydrate, and fat. The following tips are the ones that many endurance athletes use. If the guidelines work for people who push their physical limits for hours on end, imagine what they could do for you.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Graze</strong>. Instead of eating three square meals a day, as prescribed by our culture, eat five or six meals of roughly 200 to 300 calories each. When you eat a larger amount, the extra will trigger a surge of insulin in order to place the excess energy into storage. That alone is not a problem. But, it becomes one when you consume large numbers of calories, especially in the form of a high glycemic index food such as rice. Because these foods are more rapidly converted into blood sugar, the rise is quite abrupt. This, in turn, prompts the pancreas to produce a bit too much insulin, causing more sugar than intended to go into storage. Remember the sluggish feeling you experience after a big meal? Now you know why. Another way to trigger excess insulin and the same drop in blood sugar is to eat a candy bar. While not a guaranteed solution, a good place to start is by spreading the calories you need over 6 smaller meals instead of the traditional 3. Now your blood sugar will be more constant during the day since you are eliminating the need for an insulin surge and a subsequent drop. You’ll also be less likely to overeat.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Consume Adequate Protein</strong>. The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn without doing anything. That’s one of the reasons people who are lean and have lots of muscle can get away with eating large portions without gaining excess weight. Building muscle requires adequate protein in your diet. There’s considerable information about the amount of protein you should consume relative to carbohydrate, and there’s no telling what the latest fad will call for at the time you are reading this. Instead of worrying about percentage of intake, determine your ideal weight and then make sure you consume one gram of protein for each pound of ideal body weight you are striving toward. This is the recommended amount for active people whose ranks you are, hopefully, about to join. If you take up bodybuilding or start running marathons, you may need more. You need protein for everything from muscle to immune system antibodies. Many brain chemicals are also made from the amino acids you get from protein. Foods such as milk, cheese, eggs, poultry, red meat, and fish are good sources of protein. That’s why I always take high protein energy bars with me when training and racing. I also take some that are high in carbohydrates when I need a quick energy boost.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Understand Different Types of Carbohydrates</strong>. Carbohydrates contain four calories per gram and are the main energy source for the body. When three or more 6-carbon sugar molecules are joined, the resulting molecule is known as a complex carbohydrate. One or two 6-carbon sugar molecules linked together comprise a simple sugar. Complex carbohydrates are further sub-classified into fibrous and starchy carbohydrates. When consumed, simple sugars, like sucrose and dextrose, as well as refined complex carbohydrates, like white flour, provide a burst of energy that often gives way to feelings of lethargy. Typically, unrefined complex carbohydrates are assimilated by the system more slowly than simple sugars and will provide constant and sustained (though less intense) energy levels.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Limit Sugars in Favor of Low Glycemic Index Carbohydrates</strong>. The lower the glycemic index of a given carbohydrate, the more gradually it will be digested into its component parts and absorbed from the GI tract into the bloodstream. Less insulin is released from the pancreas over a given time in response to foods with low glycemic indices. Hence, the body has more time to utilize the molecules for fuel, rather than storing them as fat.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Consume Adequate Fiber</strong>. Because the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract cannot digest fiber, it does not contribute calories and is passed as waste. It is, nonetheless, vital to good health. Inadequate dietary fiber leads to a sluggish GI tract, water retention, bloating, constipation, and an increased risk of developing colon cancer. In addition to being rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, fruits and leafy vegetables are excellent fiber sources, and most experts advise consuming at least five servings per day. For optimal fat burning, limit starchy carbohydrate consumption later in the day, eating plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, instead.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Eat a Low-Fat Diet</strong>. Fats contain 9 calories per gram, more than twice the amount found in carbohydrates and proteins. Saturated fats, derived from animal sources, have been shown to contribute more heavily to the development of cardiovascular disease than unsaturated fats, derived from plant sources. For health reasons, fats should be limited to less than 20% of total, consumed calories.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Drink A Lot of Water</strong>. Many nutritionists recommend that the active individual consume a minimum of one gallon of water per day, although that will vary depending upon your level of activity and the weather. Water aids the liver and kidneys in the detoxification of poisons and in the elimination of wastes from the body. Without sufficient water, we become dehydrated, and our organs (including muscle, liver, and kidney) do not function optimally. Optimal kidney function leaves the liver free to perform maximum lypolysis, or fat burning. In addition, water is both an appetite suppressant as well as an excellent diuretic. Not only will high fluid intake increase urination, it also will decrease overall water retention. Although you may have to work up to a gallon a day gradually over a week or so while your bladder adjusts, you will reap the benefits of your efforts almost immediately. In fact, drinking water below your body temperature can actually help you to lose weight. Did you know that consuming one gallon of water chilled to 4 degrees Fahrenheit could cause your body to liberate over 150 calories of energy? What an easy way to burn fat! Of course if you are running low on energy, this practice could, theoretically, make you even more lethargic, but probably not as much as the extra weight you are carrying. Therefore, I wouldn’t be concerned about this issue.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Aim to Prevent, Not Quench, Your Thirst</strong>. Proper hydration leads to enhanced thermo- regulation and increased oxygen exchange in the lungs. Simply stated, the well-hydrated individual will have greater endurance and a more comfortable workout. Since we do not feel thirsty until we are already in a dehydrated state, it is best to drink water with sufficient frequency to prevent thirst.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Eliminate Alcohol</strong>. Alcohol is not exactly classified as a nutrient, but it is widely consumed and warrants mention. Alcohol is the enemy of the dieter and the athlete. It contains 7 calories per gram, nearly as much as fat, and is completely without nutritional value. Not only does alcohol contribute empty calories, it slows the body's metabolic rate so that fewer calories are burned over time. In addition, alcohol consumption leads to a transient hypoglycemic state and subsequent food cravings. Finally, alcohol is hepatotoxic, and even moderate drinking can result in fatty deposits on the liver. While the liver works hard to detoxify the system of alcohol, it is less efficient at lipolysis, or fat burning.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Keep Track</strong>. Use a book or other guide to keep track of your total calorie consumption as well as your intake proportion of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. You should measure your food (with a measuring cup or scale) until you have a good idea of exactly what a portion actually represents. Most people overestimate portion size and, hence, underestimate their caloric intake. Some of the best resources are those published by the American Dietetic Association.</p>
